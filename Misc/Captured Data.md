# Captured Data

An xlsx file was provided containing seemingly random occurrences of 'abcdef' and 'bc'.

## Analysis
Upon examination of the data, a pattern emerged:
- 'abcdef' represents 0
- 'bc' represents 1

## Solution
1. Convert the occurrences to their binary representations:
   - Replace 'abcdef' with 0
   - Replace 'bc' with 1

2. The resulting binary string, when decoded, reveals the flag.
