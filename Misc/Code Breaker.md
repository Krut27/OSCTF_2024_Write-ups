# Code Breaker

## Solution

- On connecting to the minecraft server we see that there are 8 levers and we were supposed to teleport behind them to see the ones connected to redstone
- We opted to just brute the flag as there were only 70 possibilities.
- The code was 2456

## Flag

```
OSCTF{r3dst0ne_1s_3asy}
```
