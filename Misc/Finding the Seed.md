# Finding the Seed

## Solution

- We are given a minecraft server whose survival world seed we are supposed to crack
- We used the [seedcracker](https://github.com/19MisterX98/SeedcrackerX) mod to crack the seed

```
/seedcracker data bits
```

- This command can be used to load the data of structure into the seedcracker mod

```
/seedcracker crack
```

- This command cracks the seed once it has enough structural data.
