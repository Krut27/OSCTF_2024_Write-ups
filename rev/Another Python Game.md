# Another Python Game

## Solution

- We used [PyInstraxtor](https://pyinstxtractor-web.netlify.app/) and [PyLingual](https://www.pylingual.io/) to first get the .pyc file and then decompile it.
- The flag is in plaintext in the decompile output.

## Flag

```
OSCTF{1_5W3ar_I_D1dn'7_BruT3f0rc3}
```
